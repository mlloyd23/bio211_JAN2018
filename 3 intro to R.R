##Assignment 3: Intro to R
##Your name

#I have provided an excel file that contains counts of each of the four colors 
#from the 10x10 square with random placement.
#Open that file in excel and save it as a .txt file

#Read the data into R and assign it to a variable
data<-


#Assign specific columnso of data to variables to hold the number of dots of each color 
pink<-
blue<-
green<-
red<-


##Using the mean() function, calculate Mean dots/quadrat for each color


##Using the var() function, calculate Variance for each color 


##Using the sd() function, calculate Standard Deviation for each color


##Using the std.error() function (in the plotrix package)
  
  
##Calculate Standard Error for each color


##Calculate Variance:Mean ratio for each color
