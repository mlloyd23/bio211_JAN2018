##Assignment 8
##Your name

#As a continuation from assignment 7, run a tukey's post hoc test on 
#the traditional anova you ran with transfromed data to look for the difference
#in distance traveled depending on seed number (continue with the subsetted 
#data with 1,2,3,4 seeds)
#You will need to make the Seeds column a factor


#Now run a dunn's post hoc test on the Kruskal-Wallis test you ran


#We looked at the correlation between distance and time in class
#Now, look at the correlation between distance and weight
#Use the traditional Pearson's test as well as Spearman's

#Make a scatterplot of this relationship

#Using the cars dataset, run a linear regression to look for the effect
#of stopping distance on speed
