##Assignment 7
##Your name

##read in the seed dispersal data

##Make histograms of weight, time, and distance

##I'm curious about the difference in distance between bracts with different
##number of seeds. Run a traditional ANOVA to look for a difference in distance 
##traveled between bracts with 1, 2, 3, or 4 seeds 

##Make a boxplot of the data

##Now try to transform the data 

##Make a historgram of each transformation and pick the best one

##Re-run the ANOVA on the transformed data, is it different?

##Now run the non-parametric version. Is it different?
